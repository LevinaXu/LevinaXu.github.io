% \textit{"All things are interconnected, this is the essence of nature." }
I am passionate about modeling the relationships among all points (e.g., nodes, tokens, or agents). My current research interests focus on three key areas:

a) (Multimodal) Large Language Models (MLLM), Large Reasoning Models, LLM-based Multi-Agent System

b) AI for Science: Biotechnology, Physics and Chemistryâ€¦

c) Trustworthy AI: Federated (Graph) Learning, MLLM Safety and Hallucination
